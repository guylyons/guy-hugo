      <description>From its man page:
 The cat utility reads files sequentially, writing them to the standard output.
 cat does just what it says and wonderfully so. But who says there isn&amp;rsquo;t room for improvement? I first learned its usage from tldp, here: http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/basic.html
With all the bells and whistles, bat is now my go to command for peaking at files quickly when in the terminal. It has Syntax highlighting, Git integration, and automatic paging, to name some features.</description>
