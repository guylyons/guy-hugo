	Hi, my name is Guy Lyons, and I'm a developer based in <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Maine">Portland, Maine</a>.
    I develop modern web applications and services that are fast, interoperable and accessible. I've also worked as a freelance illustrator and designer.</p>
