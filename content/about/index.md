My name is Guy, and, more than anything, I love problem solving.

I began my interests in programming as a child when my father built me my first computer-- a 286 Zenith. Fast forward to 1996, when after discovering IRC I was introduced to Slackware Linux. Back when using XFree86 meant you needed to know your monitor's horizontal and vertical sync. In that time I met some amazing people as an operator in #7thSphere on undernet. I wrote my first mIRC scripts, learned some TCL using eggdrop, and wrote a bunch of really terrible leaching scripts.

I currently work as the Web Systems Adminstrator for the University of New England, where I handle DevOps and development of their flagship Drupal site.
