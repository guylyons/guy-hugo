My name is Guy.

I'm a developer working in the ever-growing little town of Portland, Maine. I like it here.

I specialize in web application development, penetration testing and email marketing. I've developed applications, sites and marketing templates for clients like NYU, University of New England and CSArt Maine, to name a few.
