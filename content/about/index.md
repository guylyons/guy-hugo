My name is Guy, and I'm a developer working in the ever-growing little town of Portland, Maine. I currently work as the Web Systems Adminstrator at the University of New England. 

If you'd like to reach out to me:

  email: yugsnoyl.guy@mailhero.com

  Find me on IRC @ Freenode #javascript, #go-nuts as cstls

My setup:

- Emacs or VS Code (I also use Vim regularly, have written plugins for Atom Editor and have never subscribed to the editor wars.)
- MacOS
- iTerm2
- Fonts: either Source Code Pro or Hack
- Note taking and time tracking: org-mode
