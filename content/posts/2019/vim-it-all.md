In the *nix world, Vim is everywhere. And so there's a really big payoff for taking the time to learn modal style editing and become really familiar with its keybindings.

I'm an avid Emacs user, but its default keybindings
are atroicious, and should not be used for practical use. So my personal choice of keybinding
is [evil-mode](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil)

But it doesn't stop at Emacs, I use Vim keybindings everywhere.

[Vimium for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en "Vimium for Chrome")

[Vim for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim)

[Vim Vixen for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vim-vixen/)

[evil-mode for Emacs](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil "Evil Mode for Emacs")

Going from editor to browser and still being able to maintain the same workflow for
moving around is extremely efficient.

I also use Vim frequently when I ssh and might not have access to Emacs (or at least
the configuration I've built for myself over the years), so switching between Vim
and Emacs or Visual Studio Code requires almost zero mental effort to adjust to.
