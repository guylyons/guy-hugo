I use both Emacs and Vim regularly and I try to incorporate Vim keybindings for nearly everything I do. It makes switching from browser to
editor very efficient, and avoids a lot of the RSI associated with the default keybindings
configured in Emacs. 

Here are some extensions and plugins I use to include Vim keybindings on my machine:
