I use Emacs and Vim regularly so I try to incorporate Vim keybindings for nearly everything I do. It makes switching from browser to
editor really efficient, and avoids a lot of the RSI issues associated with the default keybindings
configured in Emacs. 

Here are some extensions and plugins I use to include Vim everywhere on my machine:

## Web Browser

[Vimium for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en "Vimium for Chrome")

[Vim Vixen for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vim-vixen/)

## Evil Mode

[evil-mode for Emacs](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil "Evil Mode for Emacs")

[Evil Guide](https://github.com/noctuid/evil-guide)

[Vim for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim)
