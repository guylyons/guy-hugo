I had the opportunity this past week to attend my first ever [DrupalCon in Seattle](https://events.drupal.org/seattle2019). I'm
still relatively new to Drupal as a developer, but have worked with the CMS in some
capacity since 2014.

There were so many great talks and breakouts that I attended while there, and Seattle is a really great city to explore.

The strongest theme of the conference was accessibility, and how to decouple Drupal and consume API with frameworks like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

This being my first, I have no context to compare it to. I heard it was somewhat smaller this year, but everyone I met was truly engaged and excited about moving to, or being on, Drupal 8.
