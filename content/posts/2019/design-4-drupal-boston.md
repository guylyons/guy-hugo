I'm back from Design 4 Drupal in Boston. Due to logistics I only attended the first day, but had a great time learning about [Patternlab](https://patternlab.io) and component based development with [Mediacurrent](https://www.mediacurrent.com/).

The workshop we did followed along this great tutorial hosted on Gitbook.

Now  back in Maine, I'll have to put some of this to use and experiment.
