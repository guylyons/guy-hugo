I can barely belive my last post was wondering whether or not DrupalCon was going to be thing or not.
We're now in full-on self-isolation in my household and haven't left our apartment since Friday.

Since saturday I started coming down with something. I say something because, even though the symptoms are
somewhat in line with COVID-19, I'm not being considered a candidate for testing since I have not traveled.
As of today I'm just starting to feel better, and will be working remotely, but this has been a very
stressful time for myself, my family and the world. None of it seems real.

All to say, I do think there are some things we can do during this time of self-isolation and quarentine.
And I just happened to see this link trending on HackerNews this morning and signed up. I encourage anyone
out there who has time and skills to dedicate some time to contributing.

The most important thing we can all do right now is to stay home. Flattening the curve is the only real chance
at stopping the spread of this thing, and we all hope and pray that eventually a vaccine will be developed. I'm
finding a lot of emotional support on IRC, just chatting with random folks again like I used to about random things.

IRCnet, EFnet and Freenode are the networks I fequent the most. Find me on there as cstls if anyone needs to chat.
