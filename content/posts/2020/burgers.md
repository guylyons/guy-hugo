This evening I'm working on some illustrations with my wife for a newsletter
that she edits. It feels good to be drawing again, something I haven't kept in good
practice of doing since the pandemic began.

Normally I do most of my work in Illustrator and Sketch, but right now
I'm on a Linux based ThinkPad, so I'm trying my hand at learning Inkscape.

This burger guy I came up with has really grown on me. I'm done with this project
but find myself doodling this guy now even when I'm just messing around.
