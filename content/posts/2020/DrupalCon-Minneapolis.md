Well, DrupalCon in Minneapolis is in May, and I WAS looking forward to this, but with
the state of illness around the world, I'm starting to think this might not happen this year.

If I do get to, I'll only be attending one day for the Higher Ed Summit, which I attended
last year as well, and it was a really great experience.

Only time will tell, but with Harvard asking students to move off their campuses, and growing
panic on the rise, I'm quite certain I'll be sitting this one out.
