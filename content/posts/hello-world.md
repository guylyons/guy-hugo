In the tradition of the great [Brian Kernighan](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~bwk/), I begin my blog.

My intent for this blog is to act as a scratchpad and journal of my daily dev tasks.

"I think everything I've done I've done with somebody else: it's more fun to work with other people than to lock yourself in an office and do it all by yourself."
