In the tradition of the great [Brian Kernighan](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~bwk/), I begin my blog.

My intent for this is to act as a sort of scratchpad and journal of my daily dev tasks.

This site is built using the static site generator Hugo, which is written in Go. It's incredibly fast and efficient, and also supports
org files out of the box! So for any Emacs users out there, it's a great solution to blogging with org.
