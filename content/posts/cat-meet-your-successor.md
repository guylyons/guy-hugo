From its man page:

> The cat utility reads files sequentially, writing them to the standard output.

cat does just what it says and wonderfully so. But who says there isn't room for improvement? I first learned its usage from tldp, here:
http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/basic.html

<div class="note">
<p>ðŸ¤“ The Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide above is still incredibly relevant (even if that site is old as mold) and a great resource for anyone mildly interested in learning Bash shell.</p>

With all the bells and whistles, bat is now my go to command for peaking at files quickly when in the terminal. It has Syntax highlighting, Git integration, and automatic paging, to name some features.

Take a look at sharkdp's GitHub page, try it out, and overall be a happier developer in your terminal:
